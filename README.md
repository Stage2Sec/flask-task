Requirements
1. Create GitHub repos to work from
2. Ensure design decisions and instructions are expressed in README.md
3. Take the provided web app, and deploy it in a container (docker or podman)
4. Use automation of choice to orchestrate deploying the container
5. Build a custom healthcheck route to the web app ensure the service is up and operational
6. Add a feature to display the results of the nmap.xml to json.  Use another route such as /nmap_json
7. Review status of healthcheck after deployment if possible
8. Build entire workflow into something unified (ie: Makefile) 
NOTE: This is not an all-or-nothing test.  If life gets in the way, we will understand - submit what you can and we can move forward from there.
